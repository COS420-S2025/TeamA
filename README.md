## Mission Statement Drafts
### Draft 1
- Syllabi can be long and full of non-due date information. 
- We find it hard and time consuming to plot out due dates of assignments and exams when given a syllabus. 
- It is tedious to go through the process of accessing and reading a syllabus to find the due date for a specific assignment, especially for each assignment. 
- Reducing the difficulty in this process would free up more time for students to study and actually do assignments. 
- There are solutions that currently address this exact problem but many are paid or use AI. 
- How can this busywork be reduced?

### Draft 2
- The information that a student often looks for in a syllabus is the information about the due dates of assignments and the timeline of assignments. 
- However this information is often buried under the typical copy paste format that most syllabi follow. 
- Students spend a significant amount of time finding this information and copying it into their calendars. 
- There are solutions that currently address this exact problem but many are paid or use AI. 
- How can we reduce the time it takes students to complete this task?
