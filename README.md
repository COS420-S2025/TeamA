## Mission Statement
(1) Extracting assignment and exam dates from long, informationally dense syllabi is a tedious and time consuming process that makes tracking and logging specific deadlines difficult.
(2) For example, in COS 420, the syllabus includes a variety of information like due dates, office hours, grading scheme, etc. When all syllabi are similarly information-dense, it makes the task of logging due dates tedious and time consuming.
(3) Services such as SylCampus charge a fee to allow you to turn your due dates on syllabi into calendar files.
(4) However it fails to address the fact that most college students cannot afford or justify the fee needed to use their service and in turn alienate their main market.
(5) How can we design a way to simplify and expedite the process of logging due dates and other important dates from syllabi into our calendar without charging a fee?
