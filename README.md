## Mission Statement Drafts
### Draft 1
(1) Extracting assignment and exam dates from long, informationally dense syllabi is a tedious and time consuming process that makes tracking and logging specific deadlines difficult.

(2) For example, in COS 420 the syllabus includes a variety of information like due dates, office hours, grading scheme, etcetera. When all syllabi are similar it makes the task of logging due dates tedious and time consuming.

(3) Services such as Syllabuddy charge a small fee to allow you to turn your due dates on syllabi into calendar files

(4) Prior solutions fail to address the fact that most college students cannot afford or justify the fee needed to use their service and in turn alienate their main market.

(5)How can we design a way to simplify and expedite the process of logging due dates and other important dates into our calendar without charging a fee?

### Draft 2
(1)The information that a student often looks for in a syllabus is the information about the due dates of assignments and the timeline of assignments.
(2)However, this information is often buried under mountains of other information and students end up spending a significant amount of time finding and copying this information in to their calendars.
(3)There exist some apps and web apps that do solve this problem like Syllabuddy.
(4)These solutions may work, but are inaccessible to many college students because they are paid.
(5)How can we create a free app that will reduce the time it takes students to complete this task?
